    "#### Spotify is the comparison of daily, weekly, monthly rest counts and search queries for Artists. It is a return to the artists and the development of their creativity by questioning the artists' PR work. Increasing the interaction between the artists and the audience is the positive results on both sides. Understand which listeners listen more during the week and the week of the week; is to create a calendar for artists to edit their monthly song or album plans.\n"
